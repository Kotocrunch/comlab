  <p>Good Friday marks the crucifixion and death of Jesus Christ and is observed with great solemnity in the Philippines. It is a public holiday during which many Filipinos participate in processions, reenactments of the Passion, and prayer vigils.

Strict fasting and abstinence from meat are practiced by many, and businesses and public spaces tend to be quieter, reflecting the somber mood of the day.</p>
