  <p>Maundy Thursday is part of Holy Week and commemorates the Last Supper of Jesus Christ with his disciples. In the predominantly Catholic Philippines, this day involves church services, processions, and acts of humility such as foot washing ceremonies.

It is a solemn day for reflection and preparation before Good Friday. Many Filipinos observe fasting or attend Masses to honor the passion and sacrifice of Christ.</p>
